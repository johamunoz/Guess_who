# Guess_who
Hello everyone, I coded a children's game called Guess who.
Basically I used 3 packages of phyton numpy, pandas and random and most of the time I used conditional statements.

The program randomly selects one person from a group of 28 people, and the kid has 3 attempts to guess the selected person.

The game starts by asking the user name, then the kid has to select a person and enter the name.
On each failed attempt, the program tracks a characteristic of the selected person that differs from the child's choice.
The game ends when the kid guesses the right person or after 3 failed attempts.
