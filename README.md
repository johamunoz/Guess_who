# Guess_who
Hello everyone, I coded a children's game called Guess who.
Basically I used 3 packages of phyton NumPy, pandas, and random and most of the time I used conditional statements.

The program randomly selects one person from a group of 28 people displayed on the figure, and the user has 3 attempts to guess the selected person.

The game starts by asking the user name, then the user has to choose a person and enter the name.
On each failed attempt, the program provides a characteristic of the selected person that differs from the user's choice.
The game ends when the user guesses the right person or after 3 failed attempts.
